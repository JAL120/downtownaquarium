My process includes setting the stage for the player to explore and encounter. My process stems from the different enviornments an aquarium has to offer and I simply incorporated that into my design. I'm very proud of the way I was able to use fish tanks to introduce the player to enemies and how well I was able to get a hold on triggers.

After doing some playtesting I updated a couple of things. A concern that was brought to my attention was lighting and how things may have been too dark, especially on the outside. Based on that feedback I added and adjusted the lighting to guide the player a bit more in a less subtle more obvious way while also adding zombies to give the more apocalypse feel. This also forces the player into the aquarium due to the sheer numbers and impossibility of killing them. Along with the outside area, I've added some secret items to reward the player if they choose to explore their surroundings which includes red armor and the super nailgun. This gives the outside more of a purpose rather than just being a bland area.
