My process includes setting the stage for the player to explore and encounter. My process stems from the different enviornments an aquarium has to offer and I simply incorporated that into my design. I'm very proud of the way I was able to use fish tanks to introduce the player to enemies and how well I was able to get a hold on triggers.
