In the making of my bubble diagram, I had to envision how I saw the map in my head versus how I saw it in real life. I had to think about how the player would travel throughout the map, travel to each exhibit, and see different environments. Like having the player walk through a see-through tube that allows them to see the abandoned city and what's left of it.
