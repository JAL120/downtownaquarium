Based on my first playtest, I gained advice about my map and how things feel. I learned that the way the player encounters the first enemies from the bathroom area feels appropriate, but could possibly need more room or just less enemies.

The view and direction of the map is great and can be seen through the blockout and encounters placed.

In terms of layout the loops help alot with orentation and bringing the player back to a familiar place easily.
