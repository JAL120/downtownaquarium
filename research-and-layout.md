When conducting this map, much research needed to be done in order to get the vibe and proper decoration as well as to create a type of story for the map.

These images assisted me in gaining an idea for my map. These images work for my map because the give me ideas of how I could build the fish tanks and the areas around them, as well as the different exhibits.
