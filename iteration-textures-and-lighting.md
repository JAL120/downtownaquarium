When it came to lighting I wanted to make sure my gameplay was good before I began. So after playtesting, lighting was mainly based on guidance and what created light in an aquarium. In my map things that created light on the outside were street lights while on the inside things like blue pillars in the corner or ceiling lights.

Another factor I added myself based on my multiplayer map was the water tower. In my multiplayer map the water tower created a good amount of light for each floor and I was sure to carry that over to my single player map.
